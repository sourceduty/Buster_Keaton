Keaton, who often took on multiple roles in his films, including director, writer, and actor, relied on a dedicated team to ensure the stunt's success. The construction of the facade itself had to be precise, with engineers and set designers working to create a structure that would collapse safely around Keaton. The scene was rehearsed extensively to guarantee that everything would go as planned, demonstrating the meticulous preparation that characterized Keaton's approach to filmmaking.

The impact of the falling house facade stunt extends beyond its immediate visual shock.
